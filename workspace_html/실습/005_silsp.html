                <div class="R_text1">Dave, the Streatham rapper who at just 19 has already guested with US superstar
                    Drake,
                    was awarded best contemporary song for Question Time, a seven-minute hip-hop track that criticises
                    Theresa May over lack of NHS funding, military involvement in Syria, wage stagnation and more. The
                    track
                    also castigates David Cameron over Brexit (“You fucked us, resigned, then sneaked out the firing
                    line”)
                    and ponders whether Jeremy Corbyn can be an effective, honest politician.
                    One particularly heartfelt verse attacks May over her handling of the Grenfell Tower disaster.
